				<h2 style="margin-bottom:15px;">Project Synopsis</h2>
				<h4>Motivation for the Problem</h4>
				<p>
					There are many reasons we we find this project interesting, but two points in particular stand out:
					<ol>
						<li>Table search is a relatively untapped area.</li>
						<li>Building a table search that queries multiple corpora would significantly enhance the quality of the search results returned.</li>
					</ol>
					How many of us have tried searching for a table? Many of us probably wouldn't have. It's not something that easily comes to mind; and Google Search is partly to blame for this. However, after learning about Wikitables, we realized how powerful table search could be, <i>if done correctly</i>. Wikitables in itself is very impressive, but why limit it to just Wikipedia for its data? There’s an entire web’s worth of data out there! So our project came into being as proof that Wikitables can easily be extended. We chose to extend it with tables from Data.gov’s Health section as proof-of-concept.
				</p>
				<h4 style="margin-top:30px;">High-Level Solution</h4>
				<p>
					We have implemented a form of supervised learning for our ranking algorithm, and intend it to work in a manner similar to the current ranking algorithm used in WikiTables.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our features are contain both quantitative measures and "semantic-like" measures that calculate the relationship between query terms and the terms present in our tables based on varying parameters (excluding static features). Our features include:

					<ol>
						<li>
							<strong>Query-Title Match</strong>, the relationship between the words in a query term and the title of a table.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Total Term Frequency</strong>, the cumulative disjoint term frequency of all terms in the search query that are present in a particular table.
						</li>
						<li>
							<sup><a class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf" style="color:#D86C70;text-decoration:none;" target="_blank"></a></sup>
							<strong>TF-IDF</strong>, the relationship between each query term’s frequency in a particular table with how commonly the term occurs across the entire data set.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Table Column Number</strong>, the number of columns of a given table - a static feature.
						</li>
						<!-- <li><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25" target="_blank">BM25</strong></a>, a ranking measure for tables based on the query terms appearing in each table, regardless of the inter-relationship/relative proximity between query terms within a table. -->
					</ol>
					<p>
						For the learning aspect of this project, we chose to utilize tools from the
						<a href="http://people.cs.umass.edu/~vdang/ranklib.html" target="_blank">RankLib</a>
						Library. We will be comparing the various learning algorithms it offers on our labled data set.
				</p>
				<h4 style="margin-top:30px;">Data Set</h4>
				<p>
					For the scope of this project's timeline, we extracted more than 500 tables, of which we found 112 relevant csv format tables from the
					<a href="http://www.data.gov/health/" target="_blank">Health section</a>
					under data.gov, which serves as our raw data. We constructed 42 queries and ranked the relevance of our 112 tables with respect to these queries to generate 671 labeled data instances. For each of these instances, we then computed feature vectors that consist of the rank of the table with respect to a particular query, the ID of that particular query, the features mentioned above, and comments stating the query string and the table name.
				</p>
				<p>
					To properly label our dataset, our first thought was to create a website that would allow us to crowd-source the incredible task. Due to networking and time-constraints, however, this never came to be.
					However, we were able to build a prototype, as seen below.

				<h4 style="margin-top:30px;">Testing and Training</h4>
					<p>
						We train on our data using four different ranking techniques:
						<ol>
							<li>RankNet</li>
							<li>RankBoost</li>
							<li>AdaRank</li>
							<li>Coordinate Ascent</li>
						</ol>
						 We compare how these algorithms perform with a dataset with minimal semantic features. We test the performance of our ranking algorithms using both 5 and 10 fold cross validation.
